**punkpbl** is a web application for learning individual preferences for BrewDog beer through pairwise comparisons.

Try it next time you visit one of the [BrewDog venues](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/locations/bars). The app provides suggestions for which beers to try and recommends other beers that match your preferences.

This is based on the [pypbl](https://github.com/jimparr19/pypbl) library.
